      <span>
        As a passionate SciFi fan and gamer, I have always been interested in the latest technical developments. In
        early 2022 I decided to start my web development journey with a few courses and small projects. Since I quickly
        realized that I enjoy web programming, I decided to attend a professional training course to become a web
        developer in Germany. I developed irrepressible motivation there and made progress very quickly. Creating
        realistic projects daily as well as getting code reviews from experienced developers contributed to my fast
        learning, so I developed a lot of front-end applications in the last few months. To continue developing software
        professionally in the future, I look forward to building on my experience and starting my career in IT in a junior
        developer position.

        <h3>I STARTED</h3>
        <span>
          in the automotive and industrial painting sector. I learned an incredible amount here and don't regret it for
          a second. But something kept telling me that it wasn't 100% right for me. So after an intensive search, I came
          to programming. Here I finally feel at home.
